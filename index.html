        A clever invention to help the blind and the deaf. <br>It's simple yet smart and it will hopefully give me the 7 I need.

    <h1 class="header">Why make this?</h1>
    <p class="desc container-center">
        Every year, the world is becoming more urban, and every single day, there are millions of accidents in the city. Now imagine being deaf and blind. Tough right?
        This isn't easy as some people get dogs to guide them, or a person, or a stick. But they all have their disadvantages. Dogs are hard to find, 
        finding a person that will stick to your whole life is hard, and a stick isn't really practical when faced against multiple types of obstacles. 
        I am not saying my solution is much better than others, I believe my solution has many flaws, but this is my approach to the problem.
    </p>
    <h1 class="header">My approach</h1>
    <p class="desc container-center">
        There are probably millions of ways to approach this problem and probably millions of methods to reach a solution.
        But, I would like to use a step by step procedure called Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking may seem like a geeky code language
        but that is a complete misunderstanding, matter of fact it can probably be applied to any problem.
        Computational thinking is always separated into 4 parts, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction and Algorithm. To explain this further,
        I will show you how I used Computational Thinking to create a solution for my problem.
    </p>
    <h1 class="comp-think-name">Decomposition</h1>
    <p class="comp-think container-center">
        The first step is always Decomposition, and it is to break down the problem into smaller bits 
        each bit of the problem is easier to work around. In my case, the multiple smaller problems I had to face was that if I made a speaker that will warn the user of an obstacle,
        it wouldn't work for a deaf person and/or if I use a lamp, the blind cannot tell. There are many ways to counter this but I thought that we can use a vibration motor for the deaf 
        and a speaker for the blind.
