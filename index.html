        A clever invention to help the blind and the deaf. <br>It's simple yet smart and it will hopefully give me the 7 I need.

    <h1 class="header">Why make this?</h1>
    <p class="desc">
        Every year, the world is becoming more urban, and every single day, <br>there are millions of accidents in the city. Now imagine being deaf and blind. <br>Tough right?
        This isn't easy as some people get dogs to guide them, <br>or a person, or a stick. But they all have their disadvantages. <br>Dogs are hard to find, 
        finding a person that will stick to your whole life is hard, <br>and a stick isn't really practical when faced against multiple types of obstacles. 
        <br>I am not saying my solution is much better than others, <br>I believe my solution has many flaws, but this is my approach to the problem.
    </p>
    <h1 class="header">My approach</h1>
    <p class="desc">
        There are probably millions of ways to approach this problem and probably <br>millions of methods to reach a solution.
        But, I would like to use a step by step procedure<br> called Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking may seem like<br> a geeky code language
        but that is a complete misunderstanding, matter of fact <br>it can probably be applied to any problem.
        Computational thinking is always separated into 4 parts, <br>Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction and Algorithm. To explain this further,
        I will show you how <br>I used Computational Thinking to create a solution for my problem.

        <li>Decomposition</li>
        <p>blah blah blah</p>
        <li>Pattern Recognition</li>
